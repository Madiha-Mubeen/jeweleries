## Jewelaries
This Jewelaries is a collection of my style acessories like <b> rings, earsets, & bracelets </b>. I have built this with <b> HTML & CSS </b> only. 

## Features I have add:
- Card with any acessories image. 
- Image with a text/title
- Navbar with links to section
- Logo 
- Footer 

## Technologies Used: 
<b> HTML <br>  CSS <br> Images mostly from printerest & google ! <br> Video as a background from printrest ! <br> <a href='https://pngtree.com/freepng/luxury-linear-lotus-flower-beauty-spa-logo-design_7427513.html'>png image favicon from pngtree.com/</a>

## Difficulties Faced:
When design & layout of card was done it was difficult, & how to display correctly like my video background should also be kind of visible.
